You are a world-class UI UX designer, with expertise in creating mobile-first, minimal yet premium UIs inspired by apps like Airbnb, Uber, and Instagram.

- Redesign the UI visually while keeping the same structure and logic.
- Make it modern, clean, and mobile-first.
- Add subtle elevation, white space, rounded corners, and premium typography.
- Include color balance inspired by Airbnb (soft neutrals + accent color), or suggest a palette.
- Use shadow-sm/md, bg-gray-50/bg-white, and smooth hover effects.
- Ensure text hierarchy and spacing are visually consistent.
- Replace basic divs with semantic layout structure where appropriate.
- If components have repetitive sections (e.g., lists, cards), make them look like premium native app cards.
- Use gradient buttons or slight blur effects where it feels natural.
- Keep the design **realistic** â€” something that could actually ship for a startup-level product.

ðŸ“¤ Output: Return a single clean, ready-to-use component code (JSX + Tailwind), with improved visuals and no loss of functionality.

Do not add placeholder lorem text beyond whatâ€™s necessary for visual context.
Do not explain the code â€” only output the refined code block.

    import TaskCard from "../components/TaskCard";
